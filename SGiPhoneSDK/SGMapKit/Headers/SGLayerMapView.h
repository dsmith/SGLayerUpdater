/*!
* @class
* @abstract Displays records from a layer on a MKMapView.
* @discussion ￼This is just a simple subclass of MKMapView which uses the records 
* for each registered layer as annotations. SGLayerMapView will automatically
* load more records from SimpleGeo after the view is animated. In addition, the map will attempt to load more
* records based on the @link reloadTimeInterval reloadTimeInterval @/link if no movement is created.
* Just add @link //simplegeo/ooc/cl/SGLayer SGLayer @/link object to the map view. You can disable this feature
* by calling @link stopRetrieving stopRetrieving @/link since every record retrieval requires
* an HTTP request. Also, the map will remove annotation as they move out of view. 
*
* The map view will build records based on the SGLayers 
* @link //simplegeo/ooc/instm/SGLayer/recordAnnotationFromGeoJSONObject: recordAnnotationFromGeoJSONObject: @/link
* method. Records are not automatically added to their layer when they are retrieved. In order to add
* retrieved records to their SGLayer object,
* @link addRetrievedRecrodsToLayer addRetrievedRecrodsToLayer @/link should be set to YES.
